# BSICS-SVR

## Warning

Right now this code is an unmitigated disaster on account of being based on DoA code from STM32CubeMX and a terribly outdated webserver code example. I'll update the readme once progress has been made, but expect nothing but misery if you look at it or worse try to test it yourself.

If you actually want to get ethernet to work on a Nucleo-F767ZI board, please go elsewhere.

is a good place to start.
